> Real-time **Object Detection and Segmentation** using **YOLOv8**, the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family by **Ultralytics**.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform **object detection, classification, and segmentation** using the **YOLOv8 neural network**, implemented in Python with the Ultralytics library.  

YOLOv8 is the successor of YOLOv5 â€” redesigned for higher speed, modularity, and accuracy.  
It supports both **detection (bounding boxes)** and **segmentation (pixel masks)** with easy training and inference workflows.

## âš¡ What is YOLOv8?

**YOLOv8** is a **convolutional neural network (CNN)**â€“based object detection architecture built by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).  
It improves upon earlier YOLO versions (v3â€“v7) with:

### ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Anchor-free architecture** â†’ faster training & inference  
- **Decoupled head** â†’ better objectness and classification accuracy  
- **Mosaic & MixUp augmentation** â†’ robust training  
- **Batch normalization + SiLU activation** â†’ improved convergence  
- **ONNX / TensorRT export** for deployment on edge devices  
- **Supports tasks:** detection, segmentation, classification, and pose estimation
